This is my code plan:
1. Copy all Code to another file, so I can work the logic out with the browser
and be able to easily transfer data that I want to the main file. This will help me avoid messing up functional code if I start experiemnting.
2. Start with the movement of pieces. Once I get them moving, it will be easy to identify my bugs.
3. Will likely spend most of my time in isLegal.
4. Once legal moves have been worked out, start checking for win conditions.
5. Pass pre-written tests.
6. Turn in.





1. 20pts - **Code Plan** - Include this in a `README.md` file in your folder with comments in your code
1. 20pts - **Move Blocks** - User can move "blocks" from column to column
1. 20pts - **Illegal Moves** - Prevents larger blocks from stacking on smaller blocks
1. 20pts - **Notifies winner** - When all the blocks are stacked into column 2 or 1 the user is alerted they won!
1. 20pts - **Minimum 3 Unit Tests** - Should be attached to your file the same way Tic, Tac, Toe, PigLatin or Rock Paper Scissors is done.
